# **Chirp**
### ~~Tweeter Project~~

Chirp:copyright: is a simple, single-page Twitter clone, but with a twist of honesty. From concept to direction to aesthetics, Chirp is designed to inspire unfiltered conversation between like-minded individuals.

> *Disclaimer: in the opinion of the creators of this application, the standards required for "like-minded" are met when parties share an appreciation of short, aggresive outburts; this is also the criterion for "conversation."*

Do you know something that other people should change about themselves that would make the world better? What about that thing that's evading policy makers that you just know will improve the economy? Chirp attracts the people that have answers to questions like the ones above and invites them to share them.

To reduce the barrier to entry (and appease *those* conspiracy theorists concerned with data breaches), we've elected to do away with registration. All you need to do to take flight in this platform is declare that profound idea as soon as it pops into your head. Then, another. And again. There is no such thing as a bad idea so long as it comes from you. Others may fall prey to the 'bad-idea' phenomenon, but rest assured -- in  we've built in "downvotes", "stop", and "cold!" emojicons, which you can use to let them know how you feel. Alternatively, you can always chirp about it.

## All you need to know:

1. step 1: find inspiration:
Browse the chirps of others and keep your critical thinking sharp!

2. step 2: declare & craft your chirp:
Is someone wrong on the internet? Tell them now. You can express yourself through our selection of icons that depict a comprehensive range of emotions, or you can hit the 'Declare' button, and 'Craft Your Chirp' in the textbox with the aforementioned heading.
![declare, prepare and type away!](https://github.com/Romadiansky/tweeter/blob/master/docs/feeling-inspired.png?raw=true)

3. step 3: craft carefully;
Craft your chirp with passion and candor and sincerity. **But, don't do it wrong**. If you say too much or not enough, we've prepared *a number* of creative ways of letting you know about it, every time. We take wrongness seriously at chirp:copywrite:

4. step 4: submit:
We also take 'rightness' seriously. This is why when you get it right (or right enough), we imbue each and every one of your chirps with some of the passion with which it was intended. You're welcome.

# **Chirp**
### ~~Tweeter Project~~

Chirp:copyright: is a simple, single-page Twitter clone, but with a twist of honesty. From concept to direction to aesthetic, Chirp is designed to inspire unfiltered conversation between like-minded individuals.

> *Disclaimer: in the opinion of the creators of this application, the standards required for "like-minded" are met when parties share an appreciation of short, aggresive outburts; this is also the criterion for "conversation."*


Do you know something that other people should change about themselves that would make the world better? What about that thing that's evading policy makers that you just know will improve the economy? Chirp attracts the people that have answers to questions like the ones above and invites them to share them.

To reduce the barrier to entry (and appease *those* conspiracy theorists concerned about data breaches), we've elected to do away with registration. All you need to do to take flight in this platform is declare that profound idea as soon as it pops into your head. Then, another. Then again. There is no such thing as a bad idea so long as it comes from you. Others may fall prey to the 'bad-idea' phenomenon, in which case, we have built in "downvotes", "stop", and "cold!" emojicons that you can use to express how you feel. Alternatively, you can chirp about it.

# **Chirp**
### ~~Tweeter Project~~

Chirp:copyright: is a simple, single-page Twitter clone, but with a twist of honesty. From concept to direction to aesthetics, Chirp is designed to inspire unfiltered conversation between like-minded individuals.

> *Disclaimer: in the opinion of the creators of this application, the standards required for "like-minded" are met when parties share an appreciation of short, aggresive outburts; this is also the criterion for "conversation."*

Do you know something that other people should change about themselves that would make the world better? What about that thing that's evading policy makers that you just know will improve the economy? Chirp attracts the people that have answers to questions like the ones above and invites them to share them.

To reduce the barrier to entry (and appease *those* conspiracy theorists concerned with data breaches), we've elected to do away with registration. All you need to do to take flight in this platform is declare that profound idea as soon as it pops into your head. Then, another. And again. There is no such thing as a bad idea so long as it comes from you. Others may fall prey to the 'bad-idea' phenomenon, but rest assured -- in  we've built in "downvotes", "stop", and "cold!" emojicons, which you can use to let them know how you feel. Alternatively, you can always chirp about it.

## All you need to know:

1. step 1: finding inspiration: *browse chirps*
["Browse the chirps of others and keep your critical thinking sharp!"](https://github.com/Romadiansky/tweeter/blob/master/docs/on-entry.png?raw=true)

2. step 2: declare: *is someone wrong on the internet?! tell them!*
["Is someone wrong on the internet? Tell them now. You can express yourself through our selection of icons that depict a comprehensive range of emotions, or you can hit the 'Declare' button, and in the textbox that reads, 'Craft Your Chirp', let it all hang out"](https://github.com/Romadiansky/tweeter/blob/master/docs/feeling-inspired.png?raw=true)

3. step 3: craft carefully; *we take 'wrongness' very seriously.*
["Craft your chirp with passion and candor and sincerity. **But, don't do it wrong**. If you say too much or not enough, we've prepared a number of creative ways of letting you know about it, everytime you're wrong. We take wrongness seriously at chirp:copywrite:"](https://github.com/Romadiansky/tweeter/blob/master/docs/respond-carefully.png?raw=true)

4. step 4: submit: *we also take 'rightness' seriously*
["We also take 'rightness' seriously. And when you get it right enough, we want to make sure your message is heard loud and clear. This is why we imbue each and every one of your chirps with the passion with which we know you intended it. You're welcome."](https://github.com/Romadiansky/tweeter/blob/master/docs/submit-and-enjoy.png?raw=true)
